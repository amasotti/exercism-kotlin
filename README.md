## What is Exercism?

[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) is a fantastic platform designed to help you enhance your coding abilities 
while having a blast. It provides a vast range of coding exercises and challenges across multiple programming languages.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Exercism is a very good place to test your skills, 
learn new concepts, and connect with the community of fellow learners.

## What Will You Find Here?

Nothing exceptionally interesting, to be honest. This repository contains my solutions / attempts
to various coding challenges from Exercism from the Kotlin track (I have other tracks going on as well)

It's more the typical repository-for-myself kind of thing, but if you're interested in seeing how I solved
some of the challenges, feel free to take a look.
